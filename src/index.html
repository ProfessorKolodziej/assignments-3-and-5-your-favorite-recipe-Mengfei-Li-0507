		<h2>Ingredients needed (with substitutions)</h2>
		<ul>
			<p>Vegan chik’n – If you don’t want to make your own <a
					href="https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-chicken/">vegan
					“chicken”</a>, you can replace it with a can of chickpeas or use something like Tofurky chik’n
				pieces.</p>
			<p>Yellow onion</p>
			<p>Carrots – Traditional chicken and dumplings recipes are made with a few simple vegetables, but you can
				always
				add
				more, like celery, potatoes, or green beans.</p>
			<p>Garlic</p>
			<p>All purpose flour – You’ll need flour to make the dumplings and to coat the sautéed onion, carrots, and
				garlic.
				Cake flour also works when making dumplings and will help them turn out lighter.</p>
			<p>Vegan chicken broth – Or use regular vegetable broth.</p>
			<p>Vegan creamer – Make sure to use <a
					href="https://www.noracooks.com/heavy-cream-substitute-vegan/">unsweetened
					creamer!</a> Coconut milk or <a href="https://www.noracooks.com/cashew-cream/">cashew cream</a> can
				also
				be
				used (although
				coconut milk is best).</p>
			<p>Dried thyme and parsley – Fresh herbs are good too.</p>
			<p>Frozen green peas – Feel free to add more frozen veggies if you’d like.</p>
			<p>Baking powder – To help the biscuits rise and fluff up in the soup.</p>
			<p>Plant milk – Any unsweetened dairy free milk can be used to make the vegan dumplings.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-butter/">Vegan butter</a></p>

		<h2>How to make vegan chicken and dumplings</h2>
		<p>You can whip up the vegan chicken soup and homemade dumplings in a pinch. The entire recipe comes together
			easily in one pot on the stove:</p>
		<h3>To make the chicken soup:</h3>
		<p>Heat some olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Saute the onion and carrots until softened, then add the
			garlic.</p>
		<img src="images/VeganChickenandDumplings-2.jpg">
		<p>Pour the flour over the vegetables and stir to coat.</p>
		<img src="images/VeganChickenandDumplings-3.jpg">
		<p>Add the broth and creamer to the pot. Stir until the mixture thickens a bit.</p>
		<img src="images/VeganChickenandDumplings-4.jpg">
		<p>Now you can add the herbs and seasonings, green peas, and vegan “chicken”. Stir it all together and bring it
			up to a boil. Afterward, lower the heat and let it simmer while you prepare the dumplings.</p>

		<p>Scoop 2 tablespoons worth of dough out of the bowl and gently drop them right into the simmering chicken
			soup. The dough will expand a lot, so make sure they aren’t too big!</p>
		<p>Place the lid on top of the pot and let the soup simmer until the dumplings are cooked through. Portion into
			bowls and enjoy!</p>

		<h2>Make ahead tips</h2>
		<p>This hands-on recipe is really fun to put together! If you want to save time and not make every element at
			once, follow these tips to make them ahead of time:</p>
		<ul>
			<p>Vegan “chicken”: My <a href="https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-fried-chicken/">seitan chicken recipes</a>
				can
				be cooked, then stored in the fridge for about 1 week or in
				the freezer for 3 months.</p>
			<p>Chicken soup: Make the soup without the dumplings, let it cool, and store it in an airtight container in
				the
				fridge for 3 to 4 days.</p>
			<p>Dumplings: Wrap the finished dough ball in plastic and keep it in the fridge for about 1 week.</p>
		</ul>

		<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>What do you serve with chicken and dumplings? This meal is hearty and filling all on its own. If you
				need
				a few dishes to serve on the side, I recommend making <a
					href="https://www.noracooks.com/air-fryer-asparagus/">asparagus</a>, broccoli, <a
					href="https://www.noracooks.com/potato-wedges-recipe/">potato wedges</a>, <a
					href="https://www.noracooks.com/kale-caesar-salad/">caesar salad</a>, or other light
				vegetable-forward
				sides.</li>
			<li>Can I use storebought dumplings instead? If you want to save time, make the dumplings with a
				vegan-friendly dumpling mix, like Bisquick.</li>
			<li>How can you tell the dumplings are cooked? If you’re unsure, you can cut one dumpling in half to make
				sure
				the dough is cooked through and fluffy.</li>
			<li>How do you store vegan chicken and dumplings? This is a dish that’s best served fresh because the
				dumplings tend to soak up the liquid. If you want to store the batch for later, keep the dumplings and
				soup
				in separate airtight containers in the fridge.</li>
