		<h2 class="tab0">Ingredients needed (with substitutions)</h2>
		<ul class="contenttab">
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin"><strong>Vegan chik’n</strong> – If you don’t want to make your own <a
					class="link" href="https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-chicken/">vegan
					“chicken”</a>, you can replace it with a can of chickpeas or use something like Tofurky chik’n
				pieces.</li>
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin"><strong>Yellow onion</strong></li>
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin"><strong>Carrots</strong> – Traditional chicken and dumplings recipes are
				made with a
				few simple
				vegetables, but you can
				always
				add
				more, like celery, potatoes, or green beans.</li>
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin"><strong>Garlic</strong></li>
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin"><strong>All purpose flour</strong> – You’ll need flour to make the
				dumplings and to
				coat the sautéed
				onion, carrots, and
				garlic.
				Cake flour also works when making dumplings and will help them turn out lighter.</li>
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin"><strong>Vegan chicken broth</strong> – Or use regular vegetable broth.
			</li>
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin"><strong>Vegan creamer</strong> – Make sure to use <a class="link"
					href="https://www.noracooks.com/heavy-cream-substitute-vegan/">unsweetened
					creamer!</a> Coconut milk or <a class="link" href="https://www.noracooks.com/cashew-cream/">cashew
					cream</a> can
				also
				be
				used (although
				coconut milk is best).</li>
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin"><strong>Dried thyme and parsley</strong> – Fresh herbs are good too.</li>
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin"><strong>Frozen green peas</strong> – Feel free to add more frozen veggies
				if you’d
				like.</li>
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin"><strong>Baking powder</strong> – To help the biscuits rise and fluff up in
				the soup.
			</li>
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin"><strong>Plant milk</strong> – Any unsweetened dairy free milk can be used
				to make the
				vegan dumplings.

		<h2 class="tab0">How to make vegan chicken and dumplings</h2>
		<div class="gap">
			<div class="contenttab">
				<p class="contenttext wider-margin">You can whip up the vegan chicken soup and homemade dumplings in a
					pinch. The entire
					recipe
					comes together
					easily in one pot on the stove:</p>
			</div>
			<div class="contenttab">
				<h3 class="subtitle">To make the chicken soup:</h3>
				<p class="contenttext wider-margin">Heat some olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Saute the onion and
					carrots
					until
					softened, then add the
					garlic.</p>
				<img class="img1" src="images/VeganChickenandDumplings-2.jpg" alt="step1">
				<p class="contenttext wider-margin">Pour the flour over the vegetables and stir to coat.</p>
				<img class="img1" src="images/VeganChickenandDumplings-3.jpg" alt="step2">
				<p class="contenttext wider-margin">Add the broth and creamer to the pot. Stir until the mixture thickens a
					bit.</p>
				<img class="img1" src="images/VeganChickenandDumplings-4.jpg" alt="step3">
				<p class="contenttext wider-margin">Now you can add the herbs and seasonings, green peas, and vegan
					“chicken”. Stir it
					all
					together and bring it
					up to a boil. Afterward, lower the heat and let it simmer while you prepare the dumplings.</p>
				<img class="img1" src="images/VeganChickenandDumplings-5.jpg" alt="step4">
				<h3 class="subtitle">To make the drop dumplings:</h3>
				<p class="contenttext wider-margin">Stir the flour, baking powder, salt, and black pepper together in a
					large bowl.</p>
				<img class="img1" src="images/VeganChickenandDumplings-6.jpg" alt="step5">
				<p class="contenttext wider-margin">Make a well in the middle and add the milk and melted vegan butter.</p>
				<img class="img1" src="images/VeganChickenandDumplings-7.jpg" alt="step6">
				<img class="img1" src="images/VeganChickenandDumplings-8.jpg" alt="step7">
				<p class="contenttext wider-margin">Scoop 2 tablespoons worth of dough out of the bowl and gently drop them
					right into
					the
					simmering chicken
					soup. The dough will expand a lot, so make sure they aren’t too big!</p>
				<p class="contenttext wider-margin">Place the lid on top of the pot and let the soup simmer until the
					dumplings are
					cooked
					through. Portion into
					bowls and enjoy!</p>

		<h2 class="tab0">Make ahead tips</h2>
		<div class="contenttab">
			<p class="contenttext">This hands-on recipe is really fun to put together! If you want to
				save time and not make
				every element at
				once, follow these tips to make them ahead of time:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="contenttext">Vegan “chicken”: My <a class="link"
						href="https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-fried-chicken/">seitan chicken
						recipes</a>
					can
					be cooked, then stored in the fridge for about 1 week or in
					the freezer for 3 months.</li>
				<li class="contenttext">Chicken soup: Make the soup without the dumplings, let it cool, and store it in an
					airtight container in
					the
					fridge for 3 to 4 days.</li>
				<li class="contenttext">Dumplings: Wrap the finished dough ball in plastic and keep it in the fridge for
					about
					1 week.</li>

		<h2 class="tab0">Frequently asked questions</h2>
		<ol class="contenttab">
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin">What do you serve with chicken and dumplings? This meal is hearty and
				filling all on
				its own. If you
				need
				a few dishes to serve on the side, I recommend making <a class="link"
					href="https://www.noracooks.com/air-fryer-asparagus/">asparagus</a>, broccoli, <a class="link"
					href="https://www.noracooks.com/potato-wedges-recipe/">potato wedges</a>, <a class="link"
					href="https://www.noracooks.com/kale-caesar-salad/">caesar salad</a>, or other light
				vegetable-forward
				sides.</li>
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin">Can I use storebought dumplings instead? If you want to save time, make
				the dumplings
				with a
				vegan-friendly dumpling mix, like Bisquick.</li>
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin">How can you tell the dumplings are cooked? If you’re unsure, you can cut
				one dumpling
				in half to make
				sure
				the dough is cooked through and fluffy.</li>
			<li class="contenttext wider-margin">How do you store vegan chicken and dumplings? This is a dish that’s best
				served fresh
				because the
				dumplings tend to soak up the liquid. If you want to store the batch for later, keep the dumplings and
				soup
				in separate airtight containers in the fridge.</li>
